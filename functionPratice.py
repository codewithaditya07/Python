# Write a program to create a function that takes two arguments, name and age, and print their value.
# def first(name,age):

# Write a program to create function func1() to accept a variable length of arguments and print their value.

# Write a program to create function calculation() such that it can accept two variables and calculate addition and subtraction. 
# Also, it must return both addition and subtraction in a single return call.

# Write a program to create a function show_employee() using the following conditions.
# It should accept the employeeâ€™s name and salary and display both.
# If the salary is missing in the function call then assign default value 9000 to salary

# Create an inner function to calculate the addition in the following way
# Create an outer function that will accept two parameters, a and b
# Create an inner function inside an outer function that will calculate the addition of a and b
# At last, an outer function will add 5 into addition and return it
